    <p class="description"><span class="quotation">&#8220;</span>
    As far as I can remember, I have always been a creative soul. Afraid of losing that passion, I opted out of monetizing my work. Instead, I developed skills in retail management and discovered a different passion — data and developing people. Fast forward six years later. It is time for me to expand on skills like: development and assessment, that I have grown in my role as a manager and apply them to my passion for design.
    <br>Drawing from my management experience I can better address questions like what drives a company, what needs does a team have to address, and what skills can be supported by smart information design? I see a direct application of the skill set I produced while advancing through my retail career to the work required in design. Both are about tailoring and communicating information to enable other people to succeed.</p>
